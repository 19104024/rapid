// the version of Boogie from https://rise4fun.com/Boogie is not able to prove the following program without the currently commented out invariant, but succeeds with it.

procedure F(n: int) returns (x: int)
  ensures x <= 0;  
{
 
  var found: int;
  found := 0;

  while(found == 0) 
//      invariant (found == 1 ==>  x<=0);
  {
    if(x > 0) {
      x := x - 1;
      found := 0;
    } else {
      found := 1;
    }
  }
}
