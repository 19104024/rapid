# Overview

SPECTRE is a program verification tool that parses programs and
produces first-order logic problems in SMTLIB syntax. It can be used to
verify that a loop satisfies a given
specification, without user-supplied invariants.

## What programs may be used as input?
TODO: this section is outdated
The programs must be given in a dedicated guarded command
language. Some key features of the language are:
- at every iteration, the first command whose guard evaluates to true
  is exectuted
- if a command is executed, all its assignments are performed **in parallel**
- if no guard is true, or if the optional loop condition is false, the
  loop is exited
- programs are made of a single loop, but you can specify
  pre-conditions to describe all possibles program states at the
  beginning of the execution
- you can specify post-conditions, which are used only in
  'verification' mode

See the example programs on the repository for more details.

## How to use the generated problems?

- the *verification mode* generates a first-order problem in which the
  post-condition is essentially the conjecture, and the hypotheses
  describe the semantics of the loop. Use a first-order theorem prover
  to solve the generated problem: if successful, the loop satisfies
  its specification.


## What first-order theorem prover should I use?

Any prover that supports SMTLIBv2.6-syntax can be used to
solve problems generated by Spectre. 


# Building the executable

To build the executable you will need to have Cmake installed. For
example, you can run the following commands to build the executable

```
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
